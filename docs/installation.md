## How to transfer over the files.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Windows" %}
The easiest way on Windows (7, 8, 10, 11) is to use [TI-Connect CE](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw)

Another method is using [TiLP](http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj\_tilp/).&#x20;

[ticalc.link](https://ticalc.link/) is not a recommended method on Windows as there are many driver issues.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Linux" %}
The easiest method to transfer files on Linux is to use [TiLP](http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj\_tilp/) or [ticalc.link](https://ticalc.link/). Note that ticalc.link only works with compatible WebSerial browsers like Google Chrome.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="MacOS" %}
Currently you can use [TiLP](http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj\_tilp/) on MacOS , [ticalc.link](https://ticalc.link/), and [TI Connect CE](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Chrome OS" %}
On Chrome OS you can use [ticalc.link](https://ticalc.link/) or [TI Connect CE for Chrome OS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ti-connect-ce-app-for-chr/aokihcpccmdjjkebakdanncddpdnkfla) both of these options are known to be buggy. If you have Linux on your Chromebook you should be able to use [TiLP](http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj\_tilp/).
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are windows, we have automated .EXE builds for the bridge, so you won't need to install python, dependencies, etc..!

This is very useful if you don't know anything about such things!

Download latest release [here](https://github.com/tkbstudios/tinet-bridge/releases/latest)

skip the following steps on this page if you downloaded the .EXE, you just should run tinet-bridge.exe and plug your calculator in, the magic should happen right after.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please make sure that you have Python >3.10 and pip. Python can be installed on Windows from the Microsoft Store [here](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/python-311/9NRWMJP3717K) (recommended for beginners) or from python.org [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\
On Linux, Python and pip can be installed by opening a terminal and typing:\
`sudo apt install python3 python3-pip`
{% endhint %}

* Navigate to your folder containing the extracted or cloned repository.
* Run this command in that directory/folder to install the required Python dependencies. `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
