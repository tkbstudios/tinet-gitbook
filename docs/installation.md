{% hint style="info" %}
Dev (DEV-x) versions are the most updated but are not guaranteed to be stable like stable versions (Vx.x.x).

They also offer a lot of bug fixes to known bugs in Stable releases.

You choose which release you want, we still recommend you choose.

## How to transfer over the files.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Windows" %}
The easiest way on Windows (7, 8, 10, 11) is to use [TI-Connect CE](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw)

Another method is using [TiLP](http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj\_tilp/).&#x20;

[ticalc.link](https://ticalc.link/) is not a recommended method on Windows as there are many driver issues.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Linux" %}
The easiest method to transfer files on Linux is to use [TiLP](http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj\_tilp/) or [ticalc.link](https://ticalc.link/). Note that ticalc.link only works with compatible WebSerial browsers like Google Chrome.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="MacOS" %}
Currently you can use [TiLP](http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj\_tilp/) on MacOS , [ticalc.link](https://ticalc.link/), and [TI Connect CE](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Chrome OS" %}
On Chrome OS you can use [ticalc.link](https://ticalc.link/) or [TI Connect CE for Chrome OS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ti-connect-ce-app-for-chr/aokihcpccmdjjkebakdanncddpdnkfla) both of these options are known to be buggy. If you have Linux on your Chromebook you should be able to use [TiLP](http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj\_tilp/).
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please make sure that you have Python 3.11 (Or 3.12 beta) and pip3. Python can be installed on Windows at the Microsoft Store [here](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/python-311/9NRWMJP3717K) (recommended) or from python.org [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\
On Linux Python can be installed with:\
`sudo apt install python3 python3-pip`
{% endhint %}

* Navigate to your folder containing the extracted or cloned repository.
* Run this command in that directory/folder to install the required Python dependencies. `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
