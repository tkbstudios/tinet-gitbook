# üåê TINET

## What is TINET?

TINET is a way to connect your TI-84 Plus CE calculator to the internet.\
TINET stands for TI-84 Plus CE Net (which was the old name)

***

## How did TINET come to my mind?

I discovered the gCn project but didn't work when I wanted to try it out, so I just did what every crazy developer would and created TINET

***

## What will TINET be able to do?

* Load programs from edge servers
* Gossamer-like browser
* Multiplayer
* And even more!

## What can TINET do currently?

* A pure TCP chat bridged on all platforms (discord and web)
